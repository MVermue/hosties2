This is a re-write of SM_Hosties v1.x from dataviruset. This allows support for multiple LRs occuring simultaneously as well as a plethora of additional last request games and new cvars for the most customizable Hosties yet. It opens up a new API for plugin developers to ask questions like if a player is a rebel as well as the ability to add third party last request games for each server independent of the Hosties plugin.
